# Go Vanity Docker

This is a simple go app that handles go vanity requests. 

The code is based on the [GCP example repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/govanityurls).

## Motivation

This is an alternative to my [Go Vanity Cloud Functions](https://github.com/KrishnaIyer/go-vanity-cloud-function) intended for self-hosting.

## Deployment

If you just want to deploy/test the app, you can pull the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/krishnaiyer/go-vanity-docker) directly.
